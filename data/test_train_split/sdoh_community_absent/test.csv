specific gravity 1.021, small blood, [**1-20**] white cells, [**10-7**] red cells, 0 bacteria, positive hyaline casts.  ekg - sinus rhythm, 96, normal axis, normal intervals, 0.[**street address(2) 1755**] depressions v1 through v3. pertinent studies this admission:  [**2146-12-5**], the patient had a portable kub to assess for ?bowel obstruction, and it did show a possibility of early partial small bowel obstruction, and recommended follow-up.  follow-up study done on [**2146-12-7**] showed no evidence for intestinal obstruction. ct of the head without contrast done [**2146-12-9**]--this was done for a history of prior cva with now change in mental status.  it showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and tissue loss noted in the left thalamus consistent with his old known hemorrhagic stroke. ultrasound of his right upper extremity done [**2146-12-12**] for edematous right arm showed nonocclusive clot within the right ij and one of his two brachial veins thrombosed. hospital course from [**0-0-0**]:  this is a [**age over 90 **]-year-old male, with a history of chronic diarrhea, past hemorrhagic cva, who was admitted to the [**hospital ward name 12573**] intensive care unit with an aspiration pneumonia after vomiting, and subsequent development of sepsis and respiratory failure. postextubation, it was noted that the patient had new left leg weakness and left facial droop with new dysarthria. 1) septic shock:  this was likely secondary to a sirs reaction, status post severe aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis.  the patient was admitted on the must sepsis protocol.  during his first hospital day, he was hypotensive and required both levophed and vasopressin to keep his mean arterial pressure greater than 65, his lactic acidosis peaked with a lactate level of 6.0, and he was placed on a bicarbonate drip in the setting of both nongap and anion gap acidosis.  he also required an insulin drip.  his cortisol stimulation test was negative with a baseline cortisol of 100 in the setting of his sepsis which is an appropriate response.  his aspiration pneumonia was treated with a 9-day course of ceftazidime, vancomycin and flagyl to cover nosocomial aspiration.  the vancomycin was switched to oxacillin after sensitivities came back on a staph aureus that grew out of his sputum that showed it to be sensitive to oxacillin. the patient improved rapidly after his early intervention in sepsis therapy and was weaned off vasopressors by hospital day #2.  he completed the remainder of his antibiotic course and did not have any further temperature spikes for the remainder of his icu course. 2) respiratory failure:  the patient required intubation for respiratory distress in the setting of acute aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis, as well as increased respiratory drive from two metabolic acidosis processes.  he was able to be quickly weaned off his ventilator, as his sepsis also rapidly improved.  he was extubated on [**2146-12-8**] after some diuresis to remove volume that had been given during his acute sepsis.  he remained extubated and has gradually had improving pulmonary toilet over the past few days.  the patient is currently on a scoop mask with 12 liters of flow and has had stable o2 sats of 95% or greater since then. 3) neurologic:  after extubation, it became apparent that mr. [**known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, dysphagia, and left leg weakness.  a head ct done to rule out any acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known hemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  his neurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the past few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved. he has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has 4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop is also improved.  he currently is requiring ng tube for feeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation. the plan will be to reevaluate him on monday, [**12-19**], to see if his swallowing has improved with his improved dysarthria.  he will be continued on an aspirin a day for stroke prophylaxis.  it is likely that this stroke occurred in the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes. 4) gi bleeding:  upon admission, the patient had guaiac positive ng output and stool, although there was no gross blood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  he did have a total of 3 units of packed rbcs during his hospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26, and 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  he was initially started on protonix and sucralfate for presumed stress gastritis.  after this intervention, he had no further signs of gi bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable since [**2146-12-7**].  he was then changed to lansoprazole therapy only. 5) chronic diarrhea:  the patient did not have diarrhea while npo, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube feeds.  he had no further nausea or vomiting on admission. cultures of his stool were negative.  c. difficile x 3 was negative.  stool osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  he was seen by his outpatient gastroenterologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 12575**], during this hospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  we will currently continue pepto-bismol for symptomatic relief. current output is about 200 cc/d of stool. 6) metabolic acidosis:  the patient had both a lactic acidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  his lactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap acidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  these both improved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not currently an issue. 7) acute renal failure:  this occurred also in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.  this has resolved to the patient's baseline creatinine after iv hydration, as well. 8) non-st elevation mi:  the patient ruled in after admission with a peak troponin of 0.2.  his cks and mbs were never positive.  this was likely a demand ischemia event in the setting of sepsis.  he had his aspirin restarted and was kept on beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  he has had no signs of gi bleeding on the aspirin at this time. 9) right arm venous clot:  this occurred in the setting of a right ij central line.  the central line was pulled, and the patient is now on lovenox and coumadin.  the plan is to anticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous precipitant for the clot.  edema of the right arm is now resolved. 10) endocrine:  the patient has no known history of diabetes, but has had increased blood sugars this entire hospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  he was initially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to insulin sliding scale.  he will likely need to be converted to oral insulin therapy upon discharge. 11) fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  the patient has been maintained on criticare tube feeds as a low-residue, low-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  his volume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is being actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg iv bid.  his volume status should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and conversion to po lasix.  replete potassium to be greater than 4, and magnesium to be greater than 2. 12) access:  the patient has poor iv access after his right ij was discontinued.  he had a left midline picc placed by iv therapy on [**2146-12-14**] for purposes of blood draws, intravenous lasix, and labs. 13) hypertension:  this is well-controlled on current lopressor, ace inhibitor and norvasc doses. 14) prophylaxis:  the patient is on lansoprazole for gi prophylaxis and risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping medication.  communication daily with son, [**name (ni) **], and his wife. disposition:  the patient will be discharged to the medicine team on the floor today to the geriatric service.  he is currently also being screened for rehab versus return to [**hospital 100**] rehab after improvement in his pulmonary toilets on the floor. dnr status:  the patient is do not resuscitate, but he would like to be intubated in the event of respiratory failure.",0
