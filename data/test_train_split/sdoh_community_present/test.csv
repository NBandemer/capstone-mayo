"social history:  a 50-pack-year tobacco history; half to one pack per day. physical examination on presentation:  physical examination on transfer from the medical intensive care unit revealed temperature was 97.9, heart rate was 79, blood pressure was 122/47, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen saturation was 100% 3 liters.  ins-and-outs were negative 1.83 liters out. in general, a pleasant elderly female lying in bed, in no acute distress.  head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed left eye surgical.  right eye pupil was reactive.  no jugular venous distention.  no carotid bruits. mucous membranes were dry.  a left facial droop.  left eye droop; closed.  heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds. no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  lung examination revealed right lower lobe with crackles.  the rest of the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  bowel sounds were positive. extremity examination revealed pneumo boots, left ankle with an ace bandage, left hip dressing was clean, dry, and intact with minimal bleeding, 1 to 2+ edema.  neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three. pertinent laboratory values on presentation:  her white blood cell count was 11.8, her hematocrit was 30.8, and her platelets were 154.  her prothrombin time was 12.7, her partial thromboplastin time was 25.4, and her inr was 1.1. sodium was 140, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 35, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 93.  calcium was 8, phosphorous was 2.4, and magnesium was 2. hospital course by issue/system:   essentially, this is an 81-year-old female with a history of a brain abscess complicated by residual memory impairment who was admitted on [**4-19**] with a left hip fracture, status post a left hip arthroplasty.  her postoperative course was complicated by a hemorrhage from the surgical wound requiring 10 units of packed red blood cells and multiple episodes of chest pain (ruling out for a myocardial infarction during each of these episodes). 1.  orthopaedic issues:  the patient was status post left hip arthroplasty.  the issue of anticoagulation status post surgery was a difficult one given the increased risk of pulmonary embolus, status post the orthopaedic surgery. however, given that the patient had significant bleeding, it was decided by the orthopaedic team that she would be placed on aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. as her form of anticoagulation. the patient should be following up with the orthopaedic surgeon (dr. [**last name (stitle) 9694**] in one week from her discharge, and she was to call telephone number [**telephone/fax (1) 4301**] to make an appointment. the patient had also complained of ankle pain on the left side, and it was unclear whether when she had originally fallen and sustained a hip fracture if she had also developed an ankle fracture.  the ankle film showed diffuse osteopenia with soft tissue swelling about the ankle, but no fracture had been identified. she was seen by physical therapy, and it was deemed that she would benefit from rehabilitation. the patient also has a history of osteoarthritis and was on prednisone 5 mg p.o. per day.  the patient's wound was slow to heal; likely thought secondary to her prednisone use.  she also has a history of some serosanguineous drainage from the wound, so it was thought that she would benefit from a 1-week course of keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. that she was started on on the day of discharge (on [**2140-4-26**]). 2.  cardiovascular system:  the patient has no known coronary artery disease with a stress mibi in [**2136**] showing no perfusion defects; however, she had multiple episodes of chest pain, and one episode with electrocardiogram changes. otherwise, her enzymes were flat.  thus, it was unclear if this was cardiac in etiology. the plan was for further risk stratification with a stress mibi or catheterization when she was stable from an orthopaedic standpoint. we continued her on metoprolol which was initiated while she was in the hospital at 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., and she was started on aspirin again for anticoagulation postoperatively and also for cardiovascular benefit. 3.  neurologic issues:  the patient has a history of a brain abscess complicated by memory impairment.  she was continued on aricept 5 mg p.o. q.d. and gabapentin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. for a history of neuropathy. 4.  genitourinary issues:  the patient has a history of urinary incontinence, which she exhibited while she in the hospital.  she was continued on oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5.  ophthalmologic issues:  she was continued on timolol. 6.  pulmonary issues:  pulmonary wise, the patient's respiratory status was stable.  we monitored her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation which were stable throughout her hospitalization.  there was a low threshold for obtaining a computed tomography angiogram.  she had pleuritic chest pain with decreased oxygen saturations.  however, this was not exhibited during her hospitalization.  of course, the risk was still for a pulmonary embolism given her proximity to recent orthopaedic surgery. 7.  infectious disease issues:  the patient had a low-grade temperature once during her hospitalization with a white blood cell count of 15.  her white blood cell count was unexplainable as there was no focal signs or symptoms.  she had a foley catheter until urinalysis was checked (which was negative for any signs of infection).  given that she had previously had minor serosanguineous drainage and was on prednisone, we thought it was reasonable to start her on a 7-day course of keflex for treatment of postoperative surgical wound, and she was to continue on this for one week. 8.  hematologic issues:  the patient's hematocrit remained stable after the lovenox was discontinued, and her creatinine remained between 30 and 35 with no more evidence of continued bleeding, and no more increase in left hip pain.  she continued to be monitored during her hospitalization. discharge status:  the patient was discharged to an extended care facility; [**location (un) **].",0
