occasional large bulla, diffuse ground glass appearance.  chest x-ray on [**2-5**]:  diffuse opacities bilaterally without pneumothorax and normal heart size. course in the hospital:  the patient was admitted to the [**hospital6 1760**] intensive care unit on a ventilator for treatment of pneumonia and presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome. 1.  respiratory for hypoxic respiratory failure.  the patient was continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and pressures with peep for presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome.  he was treated with albuterol and atrovent mdis as necessary.  a bronchoscopy was performed which revealed nonspecific changes.  the patient's ventilator settings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen saturations and minimize pressures.  despite multiple attempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to wean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator as of [**2145-2-25**]. 2.  infectious disease:  for the patient's pneumonia, he was begun on ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially.  this was then changed to levaquin.  multiple cultures were sent including a bronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and legionella and positive for [**female first name (un) **] albicans.  multiple blood cultures and sputum cultures were negative.  the patient was continued on levaquin as described above.  on [**2145-2-14**], the patient was hypotensive and hypothermic and was felt to be septic and a question of vent acquired pneumonia was raised.  the patient was then resumed on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed vent acquired pneumonia.  the patient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple cultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures remained negative.  antibiotics were continued. 3.  cardiovascular:  hypotension:  the patient's hemodynamics were aggressively monitored.  he was given intravenous fluids as necessary for hypotension.  eventually the patient required blood pressure support with pressors.  these were required intermittently.  during the week of [**2145-2-21**], the patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring large doses of neo-synephrine which were unable to be weaned previously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement was intermittent but during the days between [**2-21**] and [**2-25**], the patient's pressor requirements remained steady and high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses. 4.  atrial fibrillation:  the patient developed periods of atrial fibrillation throughout the course of the hospitalization.  initially these were responsive to diltiazem or spontaneously converted on their own.  one episode was associated with hypotension and the patient was attempted for dc cardioversion.  he did not respond to this and an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure support from pressors.  the patient spontaneously converted on this.  he was then maintained on amiodarone po.  he suffered from one additional atrial fibrillation episode.  an amiodarone drip was started again and the patient was returned to amiodarone po.  he was also seen in consultation by the cardiology service who recommended amiodarone intravenous and po, as was executed. 5.  endocrine:  given the patient's pressor requirements, it was presumed that the patient was potentially adrenally insufficient and would benefit from steroids.  he was maintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the course of the admission. 6.  fluid status:  the patient received large amounts of intravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout the admission.  he was ultimately 22 liters positive for the length of stay.  by [**2145-2-25**], attempts to diurese the patient with lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of atrial fibrillation as described above.  the patient's intravenous medications were double concentrated in order to minimize the patient's intravenous input, however, attempts to remove fluid were unsuccessful as described above. 7.  access:  the patient received central lines for administration of intravenous medications and arterial lines for hemodynamic monitoring.  on [**2145-2-19**], during a routine change of the patient's central line for question infection, the patient suffered a complication of internal jugular catheter placement.  he had a tension pneumothorax with hypotension and decreased oxygen saturations.  needle thoracostomy was performed immediately and the patient's blood pressure returned.  a chest tube was placed thereafter. the patient's family was informed of these complications and he suffered no further complications from the chest tube. 8.  disposition:  during the week of [**2145-2-21**], it became apparent that the patient's prognosis was poor, that multiple attempts to decrease sedation, ventilatory support and pressors were unsuccessful.  the patient's family felt that the patient would not want to live with this degree of life support and began discussions regarding withdrawal of care.  one of the patient's sons, however, was in disagreement regarding this plan.  talks continued and ultimately on [**2145-2-24**], the patient's family was in agreement that the patient should be ""do not resuscitate"" and they intended to withdrawal care the following day.  on [**2145-2-25**], the patient's family came to the medical intensive care unit and agreed to withdrawal care from the patient. at approximately 10:30 in the morning, the patient's life support was discontinued.  the patient was extubated and pressors were turned off.  he was kept comfortable with morphine drip and bolus along with intravenous ativan.  the patient's",1
