in lead 3, t wave flattening in avf.  there is a q wave in avf.  compared with a prior study form [**2165**] atrial fibrillation and a t wave inversion in lead three are both new findings. in summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents with shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is pleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on the day of presentation to the emergency department.  he is found to have bibasilar pneumonia by ct of the chest. however, the ct of the chest is not consistent with evidence of a pulmonary embolus.  the patient was initially admitted to the medical flor and treated for pneumonia.  he received intravenous levofloxacin and flagyl in the emergency department for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his history of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative setting.  blood cultures were obtained in the emergency department.  the sputum culture was not obtained initially, but was obtained later when the patient arrived on the medical floor.  the patient was continued on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well as toradol for pain control. in terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in onset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  the patient's rate was controlled with diltiazem.  when the patient was transferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus rhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the medical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the intensive care unit. in terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the patient was continued on mdi and nebulizers. in terms of gi the patient was put on zantac.  he was also put initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to the medical floor. in terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on a house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the patient was taking better po and his electrolytes were followed. the patient on the [**12-5**] in the early evening at approximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the medical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen saturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to 90% on 5 liters.  he was then put on a 50% ventimask, which increased his oxygenation to 93%.  subsequently it dropped to 91%.  the patient was then put on 50% face mask and his oxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  in the setting of his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further evaluation.  on arrival to the medical intensive care unit the patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately 50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  the patient was, however, mentating quite well throughout this period of hypotension.  he had a right femoral line placed on arrival to the intensive care unit as well as a left arterial line placed.  the patient was then started on levophed at initial dose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on vasopressin as dose of 0.04 units per minute.  the patient was continued on these pressors overnight for additional blood pressure support.  the patient also was treated with 2 liters of normal saline run wide open for additional pressure support. the patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and therefore did require the initiation of the pressors as mentioned.  the patient was continued on levo, flagyl and vancomycin was also started. the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to be not elevated.  his ck and troponin were both within the normal range.  in terms of rhythm, the patient was not in atrial fibrillation on transfer to the medical intensive care unit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the medical intensive care unit. as mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive with blood pressure 60s/40s.  given his pneumonia and significant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and chills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was septic.  he was put on pressors for blood pressure support, given fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.  from a pulmonary standpoint he was treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  the heparin drip was discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a pe on cta.  he was continued on albuterol and atrovent mdis as well as flovent and serevent given his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  his blood gas on admission to the mci was 737, 29, 77.  from a gi standpoint the patient was continued on zantac.  from a renal fen standpoint, the patient was npo.  his potassium was repleted and intravenous fluids for initial level of 3.1.  it was noted that his creatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely secondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension. his creatinine was followed closely every day.  from an infectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent for culture.  preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  at the time of this dictation there is no additional data on respiratory culture.  the patient's temperature max on the medical floor was 100.  he did not spike a temperature during his stay in the intensive care unit. on the second day in the intensive care unit on the morning following his transfer the patient had remained on a nonrebreather with o2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  his levophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and ultimately down to 3.  his vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight on the first evening in the intensive care unit.  he also received q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  laboratory data on the morning following his admission to the micu included a white count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8, repeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1, chloride 106, bicarb 15, bun 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103. cks were 101, 84, and 82.  troponin less then 0.3.  calcium 7.7, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.3.  cortisol was sent off and came back at 14.  coagulation studies revealed a pt of 14.5, ptt 32.8, inr of 1.5.  microbiology data still with a sputum gram stain 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram positive rods.  no respiratory culture data as of yet. in terms of the patient's pneumonia he was continued on levo, flagyl and vancomycin.  white blood cell count was noted to be up, however, the patient remained afebrile and his oxygen saturation remained good on the nonrebreather. in terms of his hypotension and sepsis, the decision was made to give the patient 1 liter of d5w with 3 amps of bicarb to be repeated times two or three as needed for blood pressure support.  it was also decided to start the patient on high dose steroids hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hours times three doses.  there was discussion with the team whether the patient would be a candidate for activated protein c.  the conclusion was that the patient would possibly be a candidate and the team decided to wait to see how he did throughout the afternoon on the [**12-6**] before actually starting the patient on the activated protein c. in terms of the patient's renal failure his creatinine was 1.4 again the morning following his admission to the micu.  a notable increase from his baseline of .6.  it was felt that this bump in his creatinine was due to hyperperfusion in the setting of hypotension and the patient was given hydration as mentioned with 1 liter fluid boluses.  he was continued on levofloxacin and vancomycin at full dose as opposed to renally dosing them given how sick he was. in terms of his acid base status, the patient's bicarb was 16 on the morning following his admission to the micu.  his lactate was up to 3.5.  his morning blood gas was 7.33, 34, 87 indicating the patient was adequately compensating for his metabolic acidosis. from a gi standpoint the patient was continued on zantac.  in terms of prophylaxis the patient was put on subcutaneous heparin.  in terms of pain the patient was continued on toradol for his pleuritic chest pain. at the time of this dictation, which is the [**12-7**] the patient has been off of his levophed since 3:00 p.m. on [**2172-7-6**].  he has been approximately 24 hours off of levophed and has been off vasopressin for approximately a day and a half.  his laboratory data is much improved at the time of this dictation.  his bicarb is up to 26.  his creatinine is down to 0.9.  his blood pressure has been completely stable following volume boluses, which have included a total of 2 liters of d5w each with 3 amps of sodium bicarb.  he has had no temperature spikes and his o2 sats have been in high 90s on a nonrebreather and ultimately on 4 liters nasal cannula. his laboratory data is notable for a white blood cell count increase to 17.9 in the setting of high dose steroids. hematocrit 30.9 in the setting of aggresive hydration. sodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, bicarb 26, bun 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 109, calcium 7.8, magnesium 2.1, phos 3.7, cortisol 14, albumin 2.6.  the patient's microdata, only the sputum gram stain is back with 4 positive gram positive coxae in pairs and cultures.  culture data is pending.  blood cultures are no growth so far. from a pneumonia standpoint the patient is continued on broad spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, flagyl and vancomycin.  his respiratory status is significantly improved and he is on nasal cannula 4 liters.  he has not had any temperature spikes during his stay in the intensive care unit. from a hypotension/sepsis standpoint the patient's blood pressures have been completely stable overnight as well as the entire day on the [**7-6**].  he has been on pressors for more then 24 hours.  his blood pressure is 99 to 122 systolic/65 to 80 diastolic.  the patient never received activated protein c.  instead he received broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation and high dose steroids. from a renal standpoint his creatinine is trending down nicely to 0.9.  he is starting to mobilize his fluids and his renal function appears to be improved. from an acid base standpoint it has lactated down today to 1.9.  arterial blood gas was 7.44, 51, 114, bicarb of 226 yesterday afternoon and again this morning.  his acidosis has resoled. in terms of hematologic, the patient's hematocrit is noted to be 30.9 down from 33 in the setting of being approximately 3 liters positive over the past 24 hours.  his admission hematocrit is noted to be 34, therefore we are checking iron studies, ldh, haptoglobin, b-12 and folate levels.  the patient is without any known history of anemia.  his stools will be guaiaced during the remainder of his hospital stay. in terms of gi the patient was continued on zantac.  his diet will be advanced today as tolerated. in terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, the patient's electrolytes were essentially within normal limits.  it was noted that his albumin was decreased to 2.6, which seems somewhat dramatic given that he has been without nutritional support for only two days.  it is now clear what his baseline albumin is, but he looks like he is a well developed, well nourished gentleman and this may be something for his primary care physician to follow up in the outpatient setting. in terms of disposition the patient is full code. in terms of access his right femoral and left arterial line were both pulled without any adverse event on the [**2172-7-6**].  communications have been with the patient's wife and daughter who have been in the hospital for much of his hospital stay in the intensive care unit.  the remainder of the [**hospital 228**] hospital stay including his discharge medications will be dictated at the time of discharge.  he is being transferred to the medical floor on vancomycin 1 gram q 12 hours, levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d., zantac 50 mg po t.i.d., albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, tylenol, flovent, serevent, droperidol, aspirin and prednisone 60 mg po q
