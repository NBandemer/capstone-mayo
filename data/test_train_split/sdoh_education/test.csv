examination on presentation:  his temperature is 97.9, heart rate 130, blood pressure 106/65, o2 sat 92% on room air.  the patient is in mild respiratory distress with audible upper airway congestion.  he appears to be quite fatigued.  heent examination sclera anicteric.  he has small pupils, which are reactive to light.  dry mucous membranes and no oral lesions.  neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy. lungs have coarse upper airway breath sounds throughout. there is good air movement.  cardiovascular examination he is tachycardic with a irregular irregular rhythm.  normal s1 and s2.  no murmurs, rubs or gallops is heard.  abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  he has central obesity.  there are normoactive bowel sounds.  extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  there is no calf tenderness or swelling noted on physical examination. initial laboratory data:  white blood cell count 6.4 with 67% polys, 11% bands, 18% lymphocytes and 2% monocytes. hematocrit 33.2, hemoglobin 11.4, platelet count 248, mcv 92, rdw 12.6, sodium 142, potassium 3.1, chloride 111, bicarb 21, bun 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 122.  pt 13.7, ptt 28.2, inr 1.3.  ast is 10, alkaline phosphatase 53, total bili 0.9, amylase 12, ck 101 with an mb of 1 and a troponin of less then 0.3.  imaging studies showed a chest ct, which shows bilateral lower lobe consolidations posteriorly.  there is a small right pleural effusion and a trace left pleural effusion.  there is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  there is a small subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes, prevascular, pretracheal and subcranial.  electrocardiogram is notable for atrial fibrillation on initial presentation to the emergency department with a rate of 126, axis 15 degrees, t wave inversion in lead 3, t wave flattening in avf.  there is a q wave in avf.  compared with a prior study form [**2165**] atrial fibrillation and a t wave inversion in lead three are both new findings. in summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents with shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is pleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on the day of presentation to the emergency department.  he is found to have bibasilar pneumonia by ct of the chest. however, the ct of the chest is not consistent with evidence of a pulmonary embolus.  the patient was initially admitted to the medical flor and treated for pneumonia.  he received intravenous levofloxacin and flagyl in the emergency department for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his history of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative setting.  blood cultures were obtained in the emergency department.  the sputum culture was not obtained initially, but was obtained later when the patient arrived on the medical floor.  the patient was continued on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well as toradol for pain control. in terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in onset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  the patient's rate was controlled with diltiazem.  when the patient was transferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus rhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the medical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the intensive care unit. in terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the patient was continued on mdi and nebulizers. in terms of gi the patient was put on zantac.  he was also put initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to the medical floor. in terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on a house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the patient was taking better po and his electrolytes were followed. the patient on the [**12-5**] in the early evening at approximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the medical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen saturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to 90% on 5 liters.  he was then put on a 50% ventimask, which increased his oxygenation to 93%.  subsequently it dropped to 91%.  the patient was then put on 50% face mask and his oxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  in the setting of his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further evaluation.  on arrival to the medical intensive care unit the patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately 50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  the patient was, however, mentating quite well throughout this period of hypotension.  he had a right femoral line placed on arrival to the intensive care unit as well as a left arterial line placed.  the patient was then started on levophed at initial dose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on vasopressin as dose of 0.04 units per minute.  the patient was continued on these pressors overnight for additional blood pressure support.  the patient also was treated with 2 liters of normal saline run wide open for additional pressure support. the patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and therefore did require the initiation of the pressors as mentioned.  the patient was continued on levo, flagyl and vancomycin was also started. the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to be not elevated.  his ck and troponin were both within the normal range.  in terms of rhythm, the patient was not in atrial fibrillation on transfer to the medical intensive care unit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the medical intensive care unit. as mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive with blood pressure 60s/40s.  given his pneumonia and significant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and chills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was septic.  he was put on pressors for blood pressure support, given fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.  from a pulmonary standpoint he was treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  the heparin drip was discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a pe on cta.  he was continued on albuterol and atrovent mdis as well as flovent and serevent given his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  his blood gas on admission to the mci was 737, 29, 77.  from a gi standpoint the patient was continued on zantac.  from a renal fen standpoint, the patient was npo.  his potassium was repleted and intravenous fluids for initial level of 3.1.  it was noted that his creatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely secondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension. his creatinine was followed closely every day.  from an infectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent for culture.  preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  at the time of this dictation there is no additional data on respiratory culture.  the patient's temperature max on the medical floor was 100.  he did not spike a temperature during his stay in the intensive care unit. on the second day in the intensive care unit on the morning following his transfer the patient had remained on a nonrebreather with o2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  his levophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and ultimately down to 3.  his vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight on the first evening in the intensive care unit.  he also received q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  laboratory data on the morning following his admission to the micu included a white count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8, repeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1, chloride 106, bicarb 15, bun 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103. cks were 101, 84, and 82.  troponin less then 0.3.  calcium 7.7, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.3.  cortisol was sent off and came back at 14.  coagulation studies revealed a pt of 14.5, ptt 32.8, inr of 1.5.  microbiology data still with a sputum gram stain 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram positive rods.  no respiratory culture data as of yet. in terms of the patient's pneumonia he was continued on levo, flagyl and vancomycin.  white blood cell count was noted to be up, however, the patient remained afebrile and his oxygen saturation remained good on the nonrebreather. in terms of his hypotension and sepsis, the decision was made to give the patient 1 liter of d5w with 3 amps of bicarb to be repeated times two or three as needed for blood pressure support.  it was also decided to start the patient on high dose steroids hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hours times three doses.  there was discussion with the team whether the patient would be a candidate for activated protein c.  the conclusion was that the patient would possibly be a candidate and the team decided to wait to see how he did throughout the afternoon on the [**12-6**] before actually starting the patient on the activated protein c. in terms of the patient's renal failure his creatinine was 1.4 again the morning following his admission to the micu.  a notable increase from his baseline of .6.  it was felt that this bump in his creatinine was due to hyperperfusion in the setting of hypotension and the patient was given hydration as mentioned with 1 liter fluid boluses.  he was continued on levofloxacin and vancomycin at full dose as opposed to renally dosing them given how sick he was. in terms of his acid base status, the patient's bicarb was 16 on the morning following his admission to the micu.  his lactate was up to 3.5.  his morning blood gas was 7.33, 34, 87 indicating the patient was adequately compensating for his metabolic acidosis. from a gi standpoint the patient was continued on zantac.  in terms of prophylaxis the patient was put on subcutaneous heparin.  in terms of pain the patient was continued on toradol for his pleuritic chest pain. at the time of this dictation, which is the [**12-7**] the patient has been off of his levophed since 3:00 p.m. on [**2172-7-6**].  he has been approximately 24 hours off of levophed and has been off vasopressin for approximately a day and a half.  his laboratory data is much improved at the time of this dictation.  his bicarb is up to 26.  his creatinine is down to 0.9.  his blood pressure has been completely stable following volume boluses, which have included a total of 2 liters of d5w each with 3 amps of sodium bicarb.  he has had no temperature spikes and his o2 sats have been in high 90s on a nonrebreather and ultimately on 4 liters nasal cannula. his laboratory data is notable for a white blood cell count increase to 17.9 in the setting of high dose steroids. hematocrit 30.9 in the setting of aggresive hydration. sodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, bicarb 26, bun 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 109, calcium 7.8, magnesium 2.1, phos 3.7, cortisol 14, albumin 2.6.  the patient's microdata, only the sputum gram stain is back with 4 positive gram positive coxae in pairs and cultures.  culture data is pending.  blood cultures are no growth so far. from a pneumonia standpoint the patient is continued on broad spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, flagyl and vancomycin.  his respiratory status is significantly improved and he is on nasal cannula 4 liters.  he has not had any temperature spikes during his stay in the intensive care unit. from a hypotension/sepsis standpoint the patient's blood pressures have been completely stable overnight as well as the entire day on the [**7-6**].  he has been on pressors for more then 24 hours.  his blood pressure is 99 to 122 systolic/65 to 80 diastolic.  the patient never received activated protein c.  instead he received broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation and high dose steroids. from a renal standpoint his creatinine is trending down nicely to 0.9.  he is starting to mobilize his fluids and his renal function appears to be improved. from an acid base standpoint it has lactated down today to 1.9.  arterial blood gas was 7.44, 51, 114, bicarb of 226 yesterday afternoon and again this morning.  his acidosis has resoled. in terms of hematologic, the patient's hematocrit is noted to be 30.9 down from 33 in the setting of being approximately 3 liters positive over the past 24 hours.  his admission hematocrit is noted to be 34, therefore we are checking iron studies, ldh, haptoglobin, b-12 and folate levels.  the patient is without any known history of anemia.  his stools will be guaiaced during the remainder of his hospital stay. in terms of gi the patient was continued on zantac.  his diet will be advanced today as tolerated. in terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, the patient's electrolytes were essentially within normal limits.  it was noted that his albumin was decreased to 2.6, which seems somewhat dramatic given that he has been without nutritional support for only two days.  it is now clear what his baseline albumin is, but he looks like he is a well developed, well nourished gentleman and this may be something for his primary care physician to follow up in the outpatient setting. in terms of disposition the patient is full code. in terms of access his right femoral and left arterial line were both pulled without any adverse event on the [**2172-7-6**].  communications have been with the patient's wife and daughter who have been in the hospital for much of his hospital stay in the intensive care unit.  the remainder of the [**hospital 228**] hospital stay including his discharge medications will be dictated at the time of discharge.  he is being transferred to the medical floor on vancomycin 1 gram q 12 hours, levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d., zantac 50 mg po t.i.d., albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, tylenol, flovent, serevent, droperidol, aspirin and prednisone 60 mg po q day.

no edema.  the patient was awake, moaning, moving hands and feet to command.  reflexes - trace at the ankles, 1+ brachial.  skin had no rashes.  a small foot ulcer, dressed, over the ball of the right foot.  there was a right scar from previous vascular surgery on his right leg. labs on admission:  white blood count 27.4, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 404, sodium 143, potassium 2.6, chloride 114, bicarbonate 11, bun 54, creatinine 2.4, glucose 175, anion gap 18, change in his anion gap/change in his bicarbonate equals less than 0.5, calcium 9.4, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 1.7, alt 9, ast 13, alk phos 95, total bilirubin 0.7, albumin 3.4, ldh 130, total protein 5.5, amylase 94, lipase 48, ck 20, troponin 0.05, pt 14.5, ptt 28, inr 1.4.  abg initially on room air 7.26/26/64/12, lactate 5.4.  chest x-ray on admission shows a left lower lobe infiltrate and a right ij central line in good position.  urinalysis -

[**known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, dysphagia, and left leg weakness.  a head ct done to rule out any acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known hemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  his neurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the past few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved. he has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has 4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop is also improved.  he currently is requiring ng tube for feeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation. the plan will be to reevaluate him on monday, [**12-19**], to see if his swallowing has improved with his improved dysarthria.  he will be continued on an aspirin a day for stroke prophylaxis.  it is likely that this stroke occurred in the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes. 4) gi bleeding:  upon admission, the patient had guaiac positive ng output and stool, although there was no gross blood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  he did have a total of 3 units of packed rbcs during his hospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26, and 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  he was initially started on protonix and sucralfate for presumed stress gastritis.  after this intervention, he had no further signs of gi bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable since [**2146-12-7**].  he was then changed to lansoprazole therapy only. 5) chronic diarrhea:  the patient did not have diarrhea while npo, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube feeds.  he had no further nausea or vomiting on admission. cultures of his stool were negative.  c. difficile x 3 was negative.  stool osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  he was seen by his outpatient gastroenterologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 12575**], during this hospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  we will currently continue pepto-bismol for symptomatic relief. current output is about 200 cc/d of stool. 6) metabolic acidosis:  the patient had both a lactic acidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  his lactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap acidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  these both improved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not currently an issue. 7) acute renal failure:  this occurred also in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.  this has resolved to the patient's baseline creatinine after iv hydration, as well. 8) non-st elevation mi:  the patient ruled in after admission with a peak troponin of 0.2.  his cks and mbs were never positive.  this was likely a demand ischemia event in the setting of sepsis.  he had his aspirin restarted and was kept on beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  he has had no signs of gi bleeding on the aspirin at this time. 9) right arm venous clot:  this occurred in the setting of a right ij central line.  the central line was pulled, and the patient is now on lovenox and coumadin.  the plan is to anticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous precipitant for the clot.  edema of the right arm is now resolved. 10) endocrine:  the patient has no known history of diabetes, but has had increased blood sugars this entire hospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  he was initially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to insulin sliding scale.  he will likely need to be converted to oral insulin therapy upon discharge. 11) fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  the patient has been maintained on criticare tube feeds as a low-residue, low-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  his volume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is being actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg iv bid.  his volume status should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and conversion to po lasix.  replete potassium to be greater than 4, and magnesium to be greater than 2. 12) access:  the patient has poor iv access after his right ij was discontinued.  he had a left midline picc placed by iv therapy on [**2146-12-14**] for purposes of blood draws, intravenous lasix, and labs. 13) hypertension:  this is well-controlled on current lopressor, ace inhibitor and norvasc doses. 14) prophylaxis:  the patient is on lansoprazole for gi prophylaxis and risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping medication.  communication daily with son, [**name (ni) **], and his wife. disposition:  the patient will be discharged to the medicine team on the floor today to the geriatric service.  he is currently also being screened for rehab versus return to [**hospital 100**] rehab after improvement in his pulmonary toilets on the floor. dnr status:  the patient is do not resuscitate, but he would like to be intubated in the event of respiratory failure.",0

"a 50-pack-year tobacco history; half to one pack per day. physical examination on presentation:  physical examination on transfer from the medical intensive care unit revealed temperature was 97.9, heart rate was 79, blood pressure was 122/47, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen saturation was 100% 3 liters.  ins-and-outs were negative 1.83 liters out. in general, a pleasant elderly female lying in bed, in no acute distress.  head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed left eye surgical.  right eye pupil was reactive.  no jugular venous distention.  no carotid bruits. mucous membranes were dry.  a left facial droop.  left eye droop; closed.  heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds. no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  lung examination revealed right lower lobe with crackles.  the rest of the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  bowel sounds were positive. extremity examination revealed pneumo boots, left ankle with an ace bandage, left hip dressing was clean, dry, and intact with minimal bleeding, 1 to 2+ edema.  neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three. pertinent laboratory values on presentation:  her white blood cell count was 11.8, her hematocrit was 30.8, and her platelets were 154.  her prothrombin time was 12.7, her partial thromboplastin time was 25.4, and her inr was 1.1. sodium was 140, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 35, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 93.  calcium was 8, phosphorous was 2.4, and magnesium was 2. hospital course by issue/system:   essentially, this is an 81-year-old female with a history of a brain abscess complicated by residual memory impairment who was admitted on [**4-19**] with a left hip fracture, status post a left hip arthroplasty.  her postoperative course was complicated by a hemorrhage from the surgical wound requiring 10 units of packed red blood cells and multiple episodes of chest pain (ruling out for a myocardial infarction during each of these episodes). 1.  orthopaedic issues:  the patient was status post left hip arthroplasty.  the issue of anticoagulation status post surgery was a difficult one given the increased risk of pulmonary embolus, status post the orthopaedic surgery. however, given that the patient had significant bleeding, it was decided by the orthopaedic team that she would be placed on aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. as her form of anticoagulation. the patient should be following up with the orthopaedic surgeon (dr. [**last name (stitle) 9694**] in one week from her discharge, and she was to call telephone number [**telephone/fax (1) 4301**] to make an appointment. the patient had also complained of ankle pain on the left side, and it was unclear whether when she had originally fallen and sustained a hip fracture if she had also developed an ankle fracture.  the ankle film showed diffuse osteopenia with soft tissue swelling about the ankle, but no fracture had been identified. she was seen by physical therapy, and it was deemed that she would benefit from rehabilitation. the patient also has a history of osteoarthritis and was on prednisone 5 mg p.o. per day.  the patient's wound was slow to heal; likely thought secondary to her prednisone use.  she also has a history of some serosanguineous drainage from the wound, so it was thought that she would benefit from a 1-week course of keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. that she was started on on the day of discharge (on [**2140-4-26**]). 2.  cardiovascular system:  the patient has no known coronary artery disease with a stress mibi in [**2136**] showing no perfusion defects; however, she had multiple episodes of chest pain, and one episode with electrocardiogram changes. otherwise, her enzymes were flat.  thus, it was unclear if this was cardiac in etiology. the plan was for further risk stratification with a stress mibi or catheterization when she was stable from an orthopaedic standpoint. we continued her on metoprolol which was initiated while she was in the hospital at 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., and she was started on aspirin again for anticoagulation postoperatively and also for cardiovascular benefit. 3.  neurologic issues:  the patient has a history of a brain abscess complicated by memory impairment.  she was continued on aricept 5 mg p.o. q.d. and gabapentin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. for a history of neuropathy. 4.  genitourinary issues:  the patient has a history of urinary incontinence, which she exhibited while she in the hospital.  she was continued on oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5.  ophthalmologic issues:  she was continued on timolol. 6.  pulmonary issues:  pulmonary wise, the patient's respiratory status was stable.  we monitored her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation which were stable throughout her hospitalization.  there was a low threshold for obtaining a computed tomography angiogram.  she had pleuritic chest pain with decreased oxygen saturations.  however, this was not exhibited during her hospitalization.  of course, the risk was still for a pulmonary embolism given her proximity to recent orthopaedic surgery. 7.  infectious disease issues:  the patient had a low-grade temperature once during her hospitalization with a white blood cell count of 15.  her white blood cell count was unexplainable as there was no focal signs or symptoms.  she had a foley catheter until urinalysis was checked (which was negative for any signs of infection).  given that she had previously had minor serosanguineous drainage and was on prednisone, we thought it was reasonable to start her on a 7-day course of keflex for treatment of postoperative surgical wound, and she was to continue on this for one week. 8.  hematologic issues:  the patient's hematocrit remained stable after the lovenox was discontinued, and her creatinine remained between 30 and 35 with no more evidence of continued bleeding, and no more increase in left hip pain.  she continued to be monitored during her hospitalization. discharge status:  the patient was discharged to an extended care facility; [**location (un) **].",0
