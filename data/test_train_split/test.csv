[**last name (prefixes) **] performed a coronary artery bypass graft times four including left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery.  a right saphenous vein graft was harvested and used as a bypass conduit to the right coronary artery posterior descending artery, as well as the oblique marginal one and oblique marginal three.  at the time of the operating a left ventricular aneurysm was also found and three separate sutures were utilized to plicate this aneurysm.  it was seen in the anterior wall and was consistent with probable damage that he had sustained from previous myocardial infarctions in the [**2162**].  her pericardium was left open at the end of the operation.  he had an arterial line and a swan-ganz catheter used for monitoring.  two ventricular and two atrial wires were present, as well as having two mediastinal chest tubes, and one left pleural tube.  his mean arterial pressure coming off of the bypass run was 60 with a central venous pressure of 5.  his pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was 9, with a mean of 16. he was sedated on propofol and being maintained on neo-synephrine.  he was brought out of the operating theater and into the cardiothoracic surgical intensive care unit where he was weaned on the night of surgery.  he did well and was neurologically intact postoperatively. cardiovascular wise, his neo-synephrine was weaned from a drip of 1 mg/kg per minute down to 0 support.  after that was weaned he was started on aspirin.  his lasix and lopressor were subsequently held for blood pressure issues. pulmonary wise, the patient was given chest physical therapy and incentive spirometry.  his chest tubes remained in place. gastrointestinal wise, he was advanced to a diabetic/cardiac diet.  renal wise, he was making adequate urine.  his foley catheter was left in place, and he was transferred to the floor. on postoperative day two, the patient was ambulating with assistance.  he had received [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) **] consultation who recommended utilizing a regular insulin sliding-scale until he was started on appropriate oral feedings, at which time they recommended utilizing metformin 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. and to titrate to 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for blood sugar control. additionally, they recommended that the patient receive a dilated eye examination as an outpatient. on the floor, on postoperative day two, the patient was doing well until he was on the commode using the bathroom; at which time his telemetry monitor had picked up a 32-beat run of wide complex nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  the patient did develop syncope as a result of this.  he was immediately brought to the bedside.  his blood pressure at this time was 120/70.  he was back into a sinus rhythm immediately and was able to recover his affect and consciousness without difficulty. at this time, the patient had his electrolytes repleted.  he was given empiric magnesium sulfate 2 g intravenously as well as 2 g of calcium gluconate for an ionized calcium of 1.1. additionally, he was given 20 meq of k-dur p.o. times one. the patient was placed on lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. given the fact that he had his aneurysm plication, as well as a low ejection fraction with documented 30%, a history of mild mitral regurgitation, the electrophysiology consultation service was consulted to evaluate the patient.  they recommended the patient be studied outside of the 96-hour window from perfusion, as it is typical for patient's post coronary artery bypass graft to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. on the same day, postoperative day two, after the nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the patient ultimately ended up in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.  his blood pressure was in the 100s to 110s systolic.  his heart rate was 130s to 150s.  he was given intravenous lopressor 20 mg total over one hour which had little effect.  he was loaded with intravenous amiodarone 150 mg intravenously and started on an amiodarone drip at 1 mg per hour times six hours and then changed to 0.5 mg times 18 hours.  he was ultimately transferred to the intensive care unit for 24 hours on postoperative day days two through three for heart rate control.  he remained hemodynamically stable throughout the entire time and had no further ectopy.  he actually converted to sinus rhythm once he was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit. however, he stayed there overnight until postoperative day three when he was admitted back to the floor.  he was maintained oral amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.   his lopressor was titrated to affect, and electrophysiology recommended that the patient undergo a formal study on [**2184-12-13**]. note, during the patient's postoperative course he remained afebrile; however, he did have an elevated white blood cell count on postoperative day three.  his white blood cell count to rose to 24,000.  he had no identifiable source of infection.  he had a chest x-ray that was completed after removal of all of his lines and tubes, and at that time there was no focal infiltrate.  there was evidence of bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, as well as some basilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  however, the cardiac silhouette was stable with no evidence of effusion. there was no pericardial friction rub noted.  he had no productive sputum.  his sternal incision was clean, dry, and intact with no evidence of erythema or drainage.  the bilateral lower extremity saphenous vein graft harvest incisions were also pristine and without evidence of infection. due to the lack of etiology for the patient's white count it was just monitored serially, and it subsequently defervesced. it was felt to possibly be secondary to his acute stress reaction from the operation and the demargination phenomenon that sometimes occurs after a bypass run. by [**2184-12-13**], on postoperative day five, the patient was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory where he underwent a formal evaluation of his sa-node, and it was found that he had a inducible av-nodal reentrant tachycardia as well as an inducible ventricular tachycardia found in the regions.   an ectopy site was found in the region of his aneurysm plication.  he ultimately had an automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator placed in the left clavipectoral fossae through the left subclavian vein with lead placements into the right atrium and left ventricle. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged back to the floor.  over the next two days the patient remained afebrile.  his white blood cell count serially decreased to 15,000 from 24.  his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine remained stable throughout his hospital course with a discharge blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 14 and 0.8.  his discharge laboratories were significant for the white count as mentioned, with a hematocrit of 27.9 (which was stable), a platelet count of 502,000.  electrolytes were within normal limits.  his temperature was 96.6 on examination, heart rate 84 in sinus rhythm, and blood pressure 120/42.  he was satting at 98% on 2 liters.  he was in no acute distress.  his sternum was stable with no drainage.  his heart was regular with murmur or friction, no gallop rhythm.  his lungs were decreased to auscultation, but revealed no crackles, and he did have breath sounds throughout except at the bases.  he had a benign abdominal examination.  his lower extremities were not edematous, and the incision sites had steri-strips, open to air, and dry. the left subclavian approach automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator implant wound was clean, dry, and intact as well.",0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0

"social history:  a 50-pack-year tobacco history; half to one pack per day. physical examination on presentation:  physical examination on transfer from the medical intensive care unit revealed temperature was 97.9, heart rate was 79, blood pressure was 122/47, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen saturation was 100% 3 liters.  ins-and-outs were negative 1.83 liters out. in general, a pleasant elderly female lying in bed, in no acute distress.  head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed left eye surgical.  right eye pupil was reactive.  no jugular venous distention.  no carotid bruits. mucous membranes were dry.  a left facial droop.  left eye droop; closed.  heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds. no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  lung examination revealed right lower lobe with crackles.  the rest of the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  bowel sounds were positive. extremity examination revealed pneumo boots, left ankle with an ace bandage, left hip dressing was clean, dry, and intact with minimal bleeding, 1 to 2+ edema.  neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented times three. pertinent laboratory values on presentation:  her white blood cell count was 11.8, her hematocrit was 30.8, and her platelets were 154.  her prothrombin time was 12.7, her partial thromboplastin time was 25.4, and her inr was 1.1. sodium was 140, potassium was 4.3, chloride was 110, bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 35, creatinine was 1, and blood glucose was 93.  calcium was 8, phosphorous was 2.4, and magnesium was 2. hospital course by issue/system:   essentially, this is an 81-year-old female with a history of a brain abscess complicated by residual memory impairment who was admitted on [**4-19**] with a left hip fracture, status post a left hip arthroplasty.  her postoperative course was complicated by a hemorrhage from the surgical wound requiring 10 units of packed red blood cells and multiple episodes of chest pain (ruling out for a myocardial infarction during each of these episodes). 1.  orthopaedic issues:  the patient was status post left hip arthroplasty.  the issue of anticoagulation status post surgery was a difficult one given the increased risk of pulmonary embolus, status post the orthopaedic surgery. however, given that the patient had significant bleeding, it was decided by the orthopaedic team that she would be placed on aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. as her form of anticoagulation. the patient should be following up with the orthopaedic surgeon (dr. [**last name (stitle) 9694**] in one week from her discharge, and she was to call telephone number [**telephone/fax (1) 4301**] to make an appointment. the patient had also complained of ankle pain on the left side, and it was unclear whether when she had originally fallen and sustained a hip fracture if she had also developed an ankle fracture.  the ankle film showed diffuse osteopenia with soft tissue swelling about the ankle, but no fracture had been identified. she was seen by physical therapy, and it was deemed that she would benefit from rehabilitation. the patient also has a history of osteoarthritis and was on prednisone 5 mg p.o. per day.  the patient's wound was slow to heal; likely thought secondary to her prednisone use.  she also has a history of some serosanguineous drainage from the wound, so it was thought that she would benefit from a 1-week course of keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. that she was started on on the day of discharge (on [**2140-4-26**]). 2.  cardiovascular system:  the patient has no known coronary artery disease with a stress mibi in [**2136**] showing no perfusion defects; however, she had multiple episodes of chest pain, and one episode with electrocardiogram changes. otherwise, her enzymes were flat.  thus, it was unclear if this was cardiac in etiology. the plan was for further risk stratification with a stress mibi or catheterization when she was stable from an orthopaedic standpoint. we continued her on metoprolol which was initiated while she was in the hospital at 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., and she was started on aspirin again for anticoagulation postoperatively and also for cardiovascular benefit. 3.  neurologic issues:  the patient has a history of a brain abscess complicated by memory impairment.  she was continued on aricept 5 mg p.o. q.d. and gabapentin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. for a history of neuropathy. 4.  genitourinary issues:  the patient has a history of urinary incontinence, which she exhibited while she in the hospital.  she was continued on oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5.  ophthalmologic issues:  she was continued on timolol. 6.  pulmonary issues:  pulmonary wise, the patient's respiratory status was stable.  we monitored her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation which were stable throughout her hospitalization.  there was a low threshold for obtaining a computed tomography angiogram.  she had pleuritic chest pain with decreased oxygen saturations.  however, this was not exhibited during her hospitalization.  of course, the risk was still for a pulmonary embolism given her proximity to recent orthopaedic surgery. 7.  infectious disease issues:  the patient had a low-grade temperature once during her hospitalization with a white blood cell count of 15.  her white blood cell count was unexplainable as there was no focal signs or symptoms.  she had a foley catheter until urinalysis was checked (which was negative for any signs of infection).  given that she had previously had minor serosanguineous drainage and was on prednisone, we thought it was reasonable to start her on a 7-day course of keflex for treatment of postoperative surgical wound, and she was to continue on this for one week. 8.  hematologic issues:  the patient's hematocrit remained stable after the lovenox was discontinued, and her creatinine remained between 30 and 35 with no more evidence of continued bleeding, and no more increase in left hip pain.  she continued to be monitored during her hospitalization. discharge status:  the patient was discharged to an extended care facility; [**location (un) **].",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
