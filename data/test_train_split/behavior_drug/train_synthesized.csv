however, there was dilated loops of small bowel with a question of an ischemic process.  the patient then underwent an upper gastrointestinal swallow which indicated a mechanical partial small-bowel obstruction with dilation of both limbs of roux-en-y proximal to jejunostomy with decompressed small bowel afterwards; likely due to an adhesion. the patient was continued on the nasogastric tube until distention was relieved and nasogastric tube output was minimal, and we awaited bowel function and ileus to resolved. the patient eventually was able to tolerate a regular diet, and his liver function tests trended downward. the patient underwent a tracheostomy tube cholangiogram through both biliary drains on postoperative day eighteen. the biliary anastomosis was found to be patent, and there was prompt antegrade flow contrast injected into the efferent loop.  both biliary drains were subsequently capped. before discharge, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram which still revealed an unchanged inferior wall motion abnormality; however, there was significant improvement with only mild mitral regurgitation. the patient had a slight bump in his creatinine secondary to an increased level of cyclosporin which was subsequently decreased.  however, the patient continued to maintain excellent graft function. on postoperative day twenty, the patient was discharged home with appropriate follow-up appointments with dr.
