no edema.  the patient was awake, moaning, moving hands and feet to command.  reflexes - trace at the ankles, 1+ brachial.  skin had no rashes.  a small foot ulcer, dressed, over the ball of the right foot.  there was a right scar from previous vascular surgery on his right leg. labs on admission:  white blood count 27.4, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 404, sodium 143, potassium 2.6, chloride 114, bicarbonate 11, bun 54, creatinine 2.4, glucose 175, anion gap 18, change in his anion gap/change in his bicarbonate equals less than 0.5, calcium 9.4, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 1.7, alt 9, ast 13, alk phos 95, total bilirubin 0.7, albumin 3.4, ldh 130, total protein 5.5, amylase 94, lipase 48, ck 20, troponin 0.05, pt 14.5, ptt 28, inr 1.4.  abg initially on room air 7.26/26/64/12, lactate 5.4.  chest x-ray on admission shows a left lower lobe infiltrate and a right ij central line in good position.  urinalysis -

[**known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, dysphagia, and left leg weakness.  a head ct done to rule out any acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known hemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  his neurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the past few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved. he has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has 4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop is also improved.  he currently is requiring ng tube for feeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation. the plan will be to reevaluate him on monday, [**12-19**], to see if his swallowing has improved with his improved dysarthria.  he will be continued on an aspirin a day for stroke prophylaxis.  it is likely that this stroke occurred in the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes. 4) gi bleeding:  upon admission, the patient had guaiac positive ng output and stool, although there was no gross blood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  he did have a total of 3 units of packed rbcs during his hospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26, and 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  he was initially started on protonix and sucralfate for presumed stress gastritis.  after this intervention, he had no further signs of gi bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable since [**2146-12-7**].  he was then changed to lansoprazole therapy only. 5) chronic diarrhea:  the patient did not have diarrhea while npo, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube feeds.  he had no further nausea or vomiting on admission. cultures of his stool were negative.  c. difficile x 3 was negative.  stool osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  he was seen by his outpatient gastroenterologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 12575**], during this hospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  we will currently continue pepto-bismol for symptomatic relief. current output is about 200 cc/d of stool. 6) metabolic acidosis:  the patient had both a lactic acidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  his lactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap acidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  these both improved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not currently an issue. 7) acute renal failure:  this occurred also in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.  this has resolved to the patient's baseline creatinine after iv hydration, as well. 8) non-st elevation mi:  the patient ruled in after admission with a peak troponin of 0.2.  his cks and mbs were never positive.  this was likely a demand ischemia event in the setting of sepsis.  he had his aspirin restarted and was kept on beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  he has had no signs of gi bleeding on the aspirin at this time. 9) right arm venous clot:  this occurred in the setting of a right ij central line.  the central line was pulled, and the patient is now on lovenox and coumadin.  the plan is to anticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous precipitant for the clot.  edema of the right arm is now resolved. 10) endocrine:  the patient has no known history of diabetes, but has had increased blood sugars this entire hospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  he was initially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to insulin sliding scale.  he will likely need to be converted to oral insulin therapy upon discharge. 11) fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  the patient has been maintained on criticare tube feeds as a low-residue, low-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  his volume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is being actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg iv bid.  his volume status should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and conversion to po lasix.  replete potassium to be greater than 4, and magnesium to be greater than 2. 12) access:  the patient has poor iv access after his right ij was discontinued.  he had a left midline picc placed by iv therapy on [**2146-12-14**] for purposes of blood draws, intravenous lasix, and labs. 13) hypertension:  this is well-controlled on current lopressor, ace inhibitor and norvasc doses. 14) prophylaxis:  the patient is on lansoprazole for gi prophylaxis and risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping medication.  communication daily with son, [**name (ni) **], and his wife. disposition:  the patient will be discharged to the medicine team on the floor today to the geriatric service.  he is currently also being screened for rehab versus return to [**hospital 100**] rehab after improvement in his pulmonary toilets on the floor. dnr status:  the patient is do not resuscitate, but he would like to be intubated in the event of respiratory failure.",2

maximum was 99.5, his blood pressure was 100/49, his heart rate was 74, and his oxygen saturation was 96% to 99% on room air.  in general, the patient was a well-nourished gentleman in no acute distress.  cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  the abdomen was tympanitic and distended, mildly tender in the right upper quadrant, with no rebound or guarding.  extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  neurologic examination was grossly nonfocal.  cranial nerves ii through xii were intact. brief summary of hospital course by issue/system:   the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. 1.  gastrointestinal bleed issues:  the patient was transfused multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma.  the patient's coumadin was held.  his inr was 2.5 on admission.  the patient was given intravenous vitamin k and intravenous protonix q.12h. and was made nothing by mouth. an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done showed reflux from the duodenum/tumor area, but the scope could not be passed into the duodenum secondary to tumor.  a nasogastric lavage was repeated which showed coffee-grounds followed by fresh clots of red blood. the patient was sent to interventional radiology for an angioembolization.  an angioembolization was done to the gastroduodenal artery on [**7-25**].  this procedure was complicated with a right groin hematoma. on [**7-26**], the patient's hematocrit was still slowly dropping.  interventional radiology and surgery were consulted again.  the patient was sent for a repeat embolization on [**7-28**].  this embolization was complicated with a left groin hematoma and pseudoaneurysm. following the second angioembolization, the patient's hematocrit remained stable for 24 hours, and he was transferred to the medicine floor from the unit.  the patient received a total of 14 units of packed red blood cells and 10 units of fresh frozen plasma in the unit.  on [**7-30**], the patient had a prominent injection into the left femoral pseudoaneurysm. on [**7-31**], the patient had an ultrasound which showed a pseudoaneurysm still present in the left femoral area with flow through it.  his hematocrit was stable at that time. on [**8-1**], the day following the patient being transferred to the floor, his hematocrit was dropping slowly to 28 with an expanding left femoral hematoma.  the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 mg of intravenous vitamin k. vascular surgery was consulted again, and the patient was to go for repair of the left femoral pseudoaneurysm.  the patient's hematocrit was stable for the next three days at approximately 32.  his inr was corrected to 1.3. on [**8-3**], the patient was taken to the operating room for pseudoaneurysm repair.  on [**8-4**], the patient was found to still have a slowly dropping hematocrit once again. he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.  a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**8-5**] which was negative.  the patient's hematocrit remained stable at approximately 30 until discharge. 2.  cardiovascular issues:  the patient was ventricularly paced, and therefore ischemia was unable to be evaluated based on his electrocardiogram in the emergency department. the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and his antihypertensive medications were held.  the patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout his hospitalization. 3.  gastrointestinal issues:  the patient has a history of chronic constipation.  the patient was placed on a bowel regimen which included senna and docusate.  the patient was also placed on simethicone for complaints of bloating.  the patient had regular bowel movements after being transferred to the floor and did not have any further gastrointestinal complaints.  the patient was also started on viokase with meals for possible pancreatic dysfunction. 4.  coagulopathy issues:  the patient was initially admitted on coumadin with an inr of 2.5 following reversal of anticoagulation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin k  while the patient was in the medical intensive care unit.  once the patient was transferred to the floor, his inr continued to increase to a maximum level of 2.9.  the patient again received 2 more units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 mg of intravenous vitamin k while on the floor and then placed on oral vitamin k to maintain his inr at less than 1.5.  the patient was discharged with an inr of 1.3 which remained stable following the initial reversal with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin k. 5.  pseudoaneurysm issues:  the patient's angioembolization procedures were complicated with bilateral groin hematomas and a left groin pseudoaneurysm.  the patient had bilateral ultrasounds initially done showing no pseudoaneurysm on the right, just a hematoma, and a pseudoaneurysm on the left. the patient had a thrombin injection performed and a repeat ultrasound which showed the pseudoaneurysm was still present that then began to expand with an expanding hematoma and a drop in his hematocrit.  the patient went for repair of the pseudoaneurysm on [**8-3**] with no further complications. condition at discharge:  condition on discharge was good. discharge status:  discharge status was to home.",3
