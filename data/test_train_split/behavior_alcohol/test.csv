occasional large bulla, diffuse ground glass appearance.  chest x-ray on [**2-5**]:  diffuse opacities bilaterally without pneumothorax and normal heart size. course in the hospital:  the patient was admitted to the [**hospital6 1760**] intensive care unit on a ventilator for treatment of pneumonia and presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome. 1.  respiratory for hypoxic respiratory failure.  the patient was continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and pressures with peep for presumed adult respiratory distress syndrome.  he was treated with albuterol and atrovent mdis as necessary.  a bronchoscopy was performed which revealed nonspecific changes.  the patient's ventilator settings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen saturations and minimize pressures.  despite multiple attempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to wean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator as of [**2145-2-25**]. 2.  infectious disease:  for the patient's pneumonia, he was begun on ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially.  this was then changed to levaquin.  multiple cultures were sent including a bronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and legionella and positive for [**female first name (un) **] albicans.  multiple blood cultures and sputum cultures were negative.  the patient was continued on levaquin as described above.  on [**2145-2-14**], the patient was hypotensive and hypothermic and was felt to be septic and a question of vent acquired pneumonia was raised.  the patient was then resumed on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed vent acquired pneumonia.  the patient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple cultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures remained negative.  antibiotics were continued. 3.  cardiovascular:  hypotension:  the patient's hemodynamics were aggressively monitored.  he was given intravenous fluids as necessary for hypotension.  eventually the patient required blood pressure support with pressors.  these were required intermittently.  during the week of [**2145-2-21**], the patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring large doses of neo-synephrine which were unable to be weaned previously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement was intermittent but during the days between [**2-21**] and [**2-25**], the patient's pressor requirements remained steady and high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses. 4.  atrial fibrillation:  the patient developed periods of atrial fibrillation throughout the course of the hospitalization.  initially these were responsive to diltiazem or spontaneously converted on their own.  one episode was associated with hypotension and the patient was attempted for dc cardioversion.  he did not respond to this and an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure support from pressors.  the patient spontaneously converted on this.  he was then maintained on amiodarone po.  he suffered from one additional atrial fibrillation episode.  an amiodarone drip was started again and the patient was returned to amiodarone po.  he was also seen in consultation by the cardiology service who recommended amiodarone intravenous and po, as was executed. 5.  endocrine:  given the patient's pressor requirements, it was presumed that the patient was potentially adrenally insufficient and would benefit from steroids.  he was maintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the course of the admission. 6.  fluid status:  the patient received large amounts of intravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout the admission.  he was ultimately 22 liters positive for the length of stay.  by [**2145-2-25**], attempts to diurese the patient with lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of atrial fibrillation as described above.  the patient's intravenous medications were double concentrated in order to minimize the patient's intravenous input, however, attempts to remove fluid were unsuccessful as described above. 7.  access:  the patient received central lines for administration of intravenous medications and arterial lines for hemodynamic monitoring.  on [**2145-2-19**], during a routine change of the patient's central line for question infection, the patient suffered a complication of internal jugular catheter placement.  he had a tension pneumothorax with hypotension and decreased oxygen saturations.  needle thoracostomy was performed immediately and the patient's blood pressure returned.  a chest tube was placed thereafter. the patient's family was informed of these complications and he suffered no further complications from the chest tube. 8.  disposition:  during the week of [**2145-2-21**], it became apparent that the patient's prognosis was poor, that multiple attempts to decrease sedation, ventilatory support and pressors were unsuccessful.  the patient's family felt that the patient would not want to live with this degree of life support and began discussions regarding withdrawal of care.  one of the patient's sons, however, was in disagreement regarding this plan.  talks continued and ultimately on [**2145-2-24**], the patient's family was in agreement that the patient should be ""do not resuscitate"" and they intended to withdrawal care the following day.  on [**2145-2-25**], the patient's family came to the medical intensive care unit and agreed to withdrawal care from the patient. at approximately 10:30 in the morning, the patient's life support was discontinued.  the patient was extubated and pressors were turned off.  he was kept comfortable with morphine drip and bolus along with intravenous ativan.  the patient's",3

[**known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, dysphagia, and left leg weakness.  a head ct done to rule out any acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known hemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  his neurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the past few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved. he has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has 4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop is also improved.  he currently is requiring ng tube for feeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation. the plan will be to reevaluate him on monday, [**12-19**], to see if his swallowing has improved with his improved dysarthria.  he will be continued on an aspirin a day for stroke prophylaxis.  it is likely that this stroke occurred in the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes. 4) gi bleeding:  upon admission, the patient had guaiac positive ng output and stool, although there was no gross blood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  he did have a total of 3 units of packed rbcs during his hospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26, and 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  he was initially started on protonix and sucralfate for presumed stress gastritis.  after this intervention, he had no further signs of gi bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable since [**2146-12-7**].  he was then changed to lansoprazole therapy only. 5) chronic diarrhea:  the patient did not have diarrhea while npo, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube feeds.  he had no further nausea or vomiting on admission. cultures of his stool were negative.  c. difficile x 3 was negative.  stool osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  he was seen by his outpatient gastroenterologist, dr. [**last name (stitle) 12575**], during this hospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  we will currently continue pepto-bismol for symptomatic relief. current output is about 200 cc/d of stool. 6) metabolic acidosis:  the patient had both a lactic acidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  his lactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap acidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  these both improved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not currently an issue. 7) acute renal failure:  this occurred also in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.  this has resolved to the patient's baseline creatinine after iv hydration, as well. 8) non-st elevation mi:  the patient ruled in after admission with a peak troponin of 0.2.  his cks and mbs were never positive.  this was likely a demand ischemia event in the setting of sepsis.  he had his aspirin restarted and was kept on beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  he has had no signs of gi bleeding on the aspirin at this time. 9) right arm venous clot:  this occurred in the setting of a right ij central line.  the central line was pulled, and the patient is now on lovenox and coumadin.  the plan is to anticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous precipitant for the clot.  edema of the right arm is now resolved. 10) endocrine:  the patient has no known history of diabetes, but has had increased blood sugars this entire hospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  he was initially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to insulin sliding scale.  he will likely need to be converted to oral insulin therapy upon discharge. 11) fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  the patient has been maintained on criticare tube feeds as a low-residue, low-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  his volume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is being actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg iv bid.  his volume status should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and conversion to po lasix.  replete potassium to be greater than 4, and magnesium to be greater than 2. 12) access:  the patient has poor iv access after his right ij was discontinued.  he had a left midline picc placed by iv therapy on [**2146-12-14**] for purposes of blood draws, intravenous lasix, and labs. 13) hypertension:  this is well-controlled on current lopressor, ace inhibitor and norvasc doses. 14) prophylaxis:  the patient is on lansoprazole for gi prophylaxis and risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping medication.  communication daily with son, [**name (ni) **], and his wife. disposition:  the patient will be discharged to the medicine team on the floor today to the geriatric service.  he is currently also being screened for rehab versus return to [**hospital 100**] rehab after improvement in his pulmonary toilets on the floor. dnr status:  the patient is do not resuscitate, but he would like to be intubated in the event of respiratory failure.",3
