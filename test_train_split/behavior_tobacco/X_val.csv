[**first name8 (namepattern2) 333**] [**last name (namepattern1) **]. patient tolerated the procedure well. it was felt that the patient should not have surgically placed gastrostomy tube for continued feeding since he has had previous surgery on his stomach as well as intermittent elevated white blood cell counts. therefore, dobbhoff feeding tube was placed into his stomach and he was begun on tube feeds at that time, which he has been tolerating well. infectious disease"
