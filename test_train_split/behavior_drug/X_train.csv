[] iph/ivh - his l basal ganglia iph and ivh were thought to be secondary to hypertension from cocaine abuse. he did reportedly fall prior to admission, but the deep location of the bleed makes traumatic a less likely etiology. his repeat nchcts did not show any significant expansion of the hemorrhage or resultant hydrocephalus. his prior deficits from the hemorrhage were depressed loc, inattention, l gaze preference, and r hemiplegia. . [] hypertension - in order to manage his hemorrhage, the patient was placed on several oral antihypertensives but he had poor response to most of them except clonidine. his ng clonidine however resulted in periodic drops in his bp below the desired range (sbp 100-160), so he was switched to a clonidine patch. he intermittently required a nicardipine infusion for further control. he was eventually started on lisinopril 40 and hctz 25 (he did not respond well to hydralizine ng or amlodipine ng for which he was on high doses). his most recent bp regimen is listed below in his discharge medications. please titrate as necessary. .

[] gastrostomy, pneumoperitoneum - he underwent gastrostomy placement but the next day had abdominal discomfort with a finding of free air under his diaphragm. there was concern for bowel injury so an exploratory laparotomy was performed. there fortunately was no significant pathology found on the open operation. he subseuqently tolerated tube feeds and medications via gt. he has been tolerating replete tube feeds without difficulty on discharge. .
