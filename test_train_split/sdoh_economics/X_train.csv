"the patient was a heavy smoker for many years, but quit 14 years prior to admission. the patient does admit to drinking four alcoholic beverages per day, and he lives with his wife. laboratory values upon admission: unremarkable. the patient was taken to the operating room on [**2144-9-8**], where he underwent an aortic valve replacement by dr. [**first name (stitle) **] [**last name (prefixes) **]. he received a 23 mm [**last name (un) 3843**]-[**doctor last name **] pericardial valve. please see operative note for full details of operative procedures and events in the operating room. patient was transported from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in good condition intubated on mechanical ventilator and on iv neo-synephrine drip. postoperative day one, he was atrially paced for some bradycardia. he was on neo-synephrine and propofol for sedation and dopamine was started on postoperative day two, [**9-10**]. later on that day on [**9-11**], the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilator, and was successfully extubated. he required a fair amount of pulmonary toilet, and did have a lot of respiratory secretions and remained rhonchorous by examination. he was begun with gentle diuresis and was started on lopressor. his neo-synephrine had been weaned off. the following day, [**9-13**], the patient did have an episode of atrial flutter and again had another episode of atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation the following day on [**9-14**]. this was treated with iv amiodarone as well as iv diltiazem drip for rate control, and he ultimately converted back to normal sinus rhythm. his iv amiodarone was converted to p.o. over the next couple of days. on [**9-14**], the patient also underwent bronchoscopy for copious secretions and large amounts of thick tan sputum was suctioned bilaterally. patient continued to have large amounts of secretions and difficulty clearing them. he had been started on levofloxacin empirically for respiratory secretions. sputum specimen was sent on [**9-15**], which ultimately grew out klebsiella pneumonia for which he was ultimately placed on zosyn at the recommendation of the infectious disease service. subsequent blood and urine cultures have been negative to date. patient was ultimately reintubated on postoperative day nine, [**9-17**] due to increased work of breathing. he also had another episode of atrial fibrillation and flutter at that time for which he received another bolus iv dose of amiodarone and ultimately converted back to normal sinus rhythm. on [**2144-9-18**], it was evident that the patient would not wean easily from mechanical ventilator. he remained with copious secretions and with difficulty clearing those on his own. he underwent placement of a percutaneous tracheostomy as well as bronchoscopy on [**2144-9-18**]. this was performed by dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) 333**] [**last name (namepattern1) **]. patient tolerated the procedure well. it was felt that the patient should not have surgically placed gastrostomy tube for continued feeding since he has had previous surgery on his stomach as well as intermittent elevated white blood cell counts. therefore, dobbhoff feeding tube was placed into his stomach and he was begun on tube feeds at that time, which he has been tolerating well. infectious disease"
